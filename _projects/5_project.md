Customer Service is a core service for a lot of businesses around the world and it is getting disrupted now by Natural Language Processing-powered applications. 

Dining Concierge is a a serverless, microservice driven web application. It sends you restaurant suggestions given a set of preferences that you provide the chatbot through conversation. The application is completely built and deployed on AWS. The data for restaurants are scraped from yelp. We used the Yelp API to collect 5,000+ random restaurants from Manhattan.

Based on a conversation with the customer, the LEX chatbot will identify the customerâ€™s preferences. It will search through ElasticSearch to find restaurant suggestions and find more information about the restaurants from DynamoDB and mail the customers.

Additionally, it remembers your last search for both location and category. When a user returns to the chat, they automatically receive a recommendation based on their previous search.
