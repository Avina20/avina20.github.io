Built during my 2 month virtual web development internship at Amilcar Technologies. The internship provided me a platform to apply my web technology skills and glean insights from the experts of the field. I worked under the guidance of Mr. Wissem Mhenni for the recreation of their company website.

Spearheaded the redesigning, website development and filtering out relevant company information and links. The website was cross-browser/cross-device compatibile in a graded browser support environment
