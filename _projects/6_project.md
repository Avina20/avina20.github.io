ConnectX is an online service for facilitating communication among people in a neighborhood

We implemented a web-based interface where users can log in and interact with their neighbours, block members, friends and hood members. Moreover, they can also send friend requests, add neighbours, apply to be a member of a new block, send or read messages only from a specific group of people. We implemented the web-based interface using PHP as our backend framework and HTML, Bootstrap CSS & JavaScript at the front end. In this project, we used PostgreSQL as our database system and used it to create sophisticated queries that interacted with our backend to produce interesting data. To provide a user-friendly and hassle-free experience, we employed a simple and aesthetic frontend exposing certain functionalities and information to the users in the initial dashboard for quick access.

We also learnt about different kinds of vulnerabilities the database is exposed to and different techniques to overcome these. We implemented the security measures to mitigate the risks associated with SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting Attacks. To ensure the integrity of our data, we used Session Management, Transaction Scope and Session Lifetime and Concurrency handling techniques, inbuilt through PHP.
