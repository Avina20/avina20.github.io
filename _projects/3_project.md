Vacbook is an online Scheduling Reservation System for booking Vaccination Slots. The inspiration for this project is Cowin, the Indian vaccine slot booking system made for Covid-19 vaccine booking. It allows user to view, reserve, modify and delete bookings for their vaccination. It will be secure system and users can interact using the GUI made in Java. The system will verify the user and make sure correct vaccines are reserved for user, in the recommended time interval.

A database that stores calendars and appointments, where the user can access this scheduling data by connecting to a remote server. The user can make an appointment and reserve a time slot. We also ensure data integrity and availability, i.e., the system can handle multiple concurrent requests without hindering other userâ€™s activity. Use of Spring JPA and JDBC to maintain data integrity using transactional atomicity and multithreading.
